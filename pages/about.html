            Bishop David O. Oyedepo received a call into the ministry through a
            heavenly vision, where he saw a lineup of battered, beaten,
            tattered, deformed, groaning for escape, he began sobbing with the.
            In response to his question, ‘but why Lord?’ God answered, “But from
            the beginning it was not so, and now the hour has come to liberate
            the whole world from all oppression of the devil through the
            preaching of the world of faith and I AM sending you to undertake
            this task.” Today, he stands as an Apostle of Faith to the nations,

          God commissioned the presiding Bishop of this commission with a Word
          of Faith ministry to our generation. Remember Paul said, "...if the
          trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the
          battle?" (1 Cor 14:8) As a Commission, we have experienced amazing
          testimonies ever since this commission was handed down - that is over
          thirty years now! The Holy Ghost further inspired the servant of God,
          Dr. David Oyedepo, to classify the Word of Faith He has committed into
          his hands into the specific areas of emphasis, in direct response to
          Isaiah 40:6, "The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry?..."
          He has named these 12 areas of emphasis as the 12 Pillars of our
          Commission. We have crossed Jordan into power, bearing the ark of
          liberation. Here are the 12 stones, after the order of Joshua 4:1-8,
          20-24. Having stood firm upon these twelve stones! And they have
          resulted in breakthroughs - both for the ministry and all that are
          partakers with us, of the same grace.
