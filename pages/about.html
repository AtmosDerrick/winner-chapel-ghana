        Our Mandate for ministry was received from God in an 18-hour vision to
        the presiding Bishop of this commission, Bishop David O Oyedapo. During
        this vision, a commission was received from God to liberate mankind in
        all facets of human existence, to restore broken destinies, to bring
        healing to the infirmed.<br />
        This was the Divine mandate received from God: “Now the hour has come to
        liberate the world from all oppressions of the devil through the
        preaching of the word of faith, and I am sending you to undertake this
        task.”<br />
        This mandate was further confirmed from the epistle of Paul to the
        Ephesians where God Said, “Above all, taking the shield of faith,
        wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked”
        (Eph 6:16).<br />
        This was the genesis of this global ministry today and according to this
        mandate, the Word of Faith is the key to triumphant living. Shortly,
        thereafter, a weekly teaching programme took-off, popularly known as the
        Faith Liberation Hour. Alongside, a caucus was put in place, tagged The
        Power House which was involved in prayers and fasting among others
        towards the actualization of this heavenly vision.<br />
        Today, testimonies of liberation through our messages, books, CDs, DVDs,
        magazines, and other periodicals are most humbling. The word of faith is
        working like fire for the liberation of mankind across the nations.

          ever since. We currently occupy a 1500 seater Campus in the district
          of Dartford, a Children’s Church capacity of 500 and Teens Church of

          David Oyedepo received a mandate from God in an 18-hour long vision in
          May 1981 to liberate the world from all oppressions of the devil
          through the preaching of the word of faith. This is the inaugural
          vision that led to the founding of the Living Faith Church World Wide
          (LFCWW), first called Liberation Faith Hour Ministries, in 1981. Two
          years after, on September 17, 1983, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the General
          Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, ordained David
          Oyedepo and his wife, Florence Abiola Akano (now known as Faith Abiola
          Oyedepo) as pastors and also officially commissioned the newly started
          church. Five years after, David Oyedepo was ordained a Bishop. Living
          Faith Church (AKA Winners Chapel) started in Kaduna, but David Oyedepo
          moved to Lagos, the former capital of Nigeria in September 1989, to
          start a new branch after receiving an instruction from God to reach
          out to the population in Lagos. This Church in Lagos grew to become
          the International headquarters of Living Faith Church, with a
          constantly increasing flow of crowds spilling over to adjacent roads,
          and on decks of uncompleted buildings nearby, compelling people to
          stand for hours to listen to his teachings. This led to the building
          of the renowned Faith Tabernacle, as instructed by God. David Oyedepo
          is an acclaimed author and publisher who has written over 70 titles
          apart from periodicals. He is also Chairman/Publisher of Dominion
          Publishing House (DPH), a publishing arm of his ministry. DPH has over
          4 million prints in circulation to date. Through God’s grace upon him,
          Covenant University, Landmark University, Faith Academy and Kingdom
          Heritage Model Schools have been established to equip the youth for
          impact.

          <p class="text-lg text-justify para">
            On September 27, 1954, Bishop David Olaniyi Oyedepo, a native of
            Omu-Aran, Kwara State, Nigeria, was born in Osogbo into a
            religiously mixed family.<br />
            His father, Ibrahim, was a Muslim healer, while his mother, Dorcas,
            was a member of the Eternal Order of the Cherubim and Seraphim
            Movement (C&S).<br />
            He was raised by his grandmother in Osogbo, who inculcated in him
            the virtues of Christian life through the early morning prayers
            which he attended with her. She also taught him the importance of
            tithing and other basic Christian virtues.<br />
            David Oyedepo gave his life to Jesus Christ in 1969 through the
            influence of his former teacher, Ms Betty Lasher, who took a special
            interest in him during his high school days. He studied Architecture
            at Kwara State Polytechnic, Ilorin, and worked briefly with the
            Federal Ministry of Housing in Ilorin before resigning to
            concentrate on missionary work.<br />
            David Oyedepo also earned a PhD in Human Development from Honolulu
            University, Hawaii, United States of America. In 1982 he married
            Florence Abiola Akano (now known as Faith). They have four children
            together (David Jr., Isaac, Love, and Joy).<br />
            David Jr. and Isaac Oyedepo were ordained as Pastors in May 2007 by
            Kenneth Copeland.

        <p class="text-left text-lg font-sans">
          God commissioned the presiding Bishop of this commission with a Word
          of Faith ministry to our generation. Remember Paul said, "...if the
          trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the
          battle?" (1 Cor 14:8) As a Commission, we have experienced amazing
          testimonies ever since this commission was handed down - that is over
          thirty years now! The Holy Ghost further inspired the servant of God,
          Dr. David Oyedepo, to classify the Word of Faith He has committed into
          his hands into the specific areas of emphasis, in direct response to
          Isaiah 40:6, "The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry?..."
          He has named these 12 areas of emphasis as the 12 Pillars of our
          Commission. We have crossed Jordan into power, bearing the ark of
          liberation. Here are the 12 stones, after the order of Joshua 4:1-8,
          20-24. Having stood firm upon these twelve stones! And they have
          resulted in breakthroughs - both for the ministry and all that are
          partakers with us, of the same grace.
