          The Word of Faith Bible Institute [WOFBI] is a Ministry/Leadership
          Training Centre, which serves as the training arm of the Living Faith
          Church Worldwide. The institute runs a one week intensive program
          which begins at 8 am and ends at 7 pm daily. The courses are designed
          to motivate participants positively towards distinction both in their
          secular as well as spiritual engagement. The Vision of the Institute
          is in line with the mandate given to Dr. David Oyedepo in May 1983
          when the Holy Ghost said to him, “I will through THIS MINISTRY RAISE
          THE FOUNDATION OF MANY OTHER MINISTRIES”. For this reason, the
          Institute’s Curriculum is designed to inculcate covenant excellence in
          Leadership, Ministry, Social, Economic and other areas of human
          endeavours.

          WOFBI is not just a place of learning; it is actually a mountain of
          transformation.<br />
          In the words of Dr. David Oyedepo, “There is no mountain anywhere;
          every man’s ignorance is his mountain”. It is your light that defines
          your limit, if you will submit to the forces of enlightenment; you
          will subdue every mountainous issues of your life. Classes run
          throughout the year, so take advantage of this great opportunity.

          We have a strong passion for Children and the desire to see them grow
          in the knowledge of Christ. We believe that as your children become
          rooted and grounded here, they would become and remain winners in
          every area of their lives in Jesus name. The bible says in II Timothy
          3:15, “And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures,
          which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is
          in Christ Jesus”.We see it as our responsibility to make this
          scripture a reality by the help of the Holy Spirit within the time we
          spend with your child/children.<br />
          The Children’s church is designed to assist the children with
          developing a real relationship with God, Jesus Christ, and the person
          of the Holy Spirit by teaching them the word of faith that will
          deliver them from all oppressions of the devil. Our main goal as the
          leaders, teachers, and members of the Children’s church team is to
          reach out to every child with the love of Christ and do all we can to
          saturate the spirit, soul and body of the children with the word of
          God so they are equipped with all they would need to face the
          challenges of life and come out triumphant.<br />
          We seek to do so in an age appropriate, exciting and fun filled way
          which will cause the children to have a thirst, not just for the
          knowledge of the word of God, but more importantly, for understanding.
          We believe that it is when the children have understanding that they
          can begin to walk towards a lifetime of excellence in every area of
          their lives. The Children’s Church services holds at 9am and 11:15am.
